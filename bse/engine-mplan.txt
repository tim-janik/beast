conceptual approach to simulate flow-system behavior
====================================================

introductionary remarks:
------------------------
the GSL engine simulates signal flow systems by mapping them
onto a network of signal processing modules which are connected
via signal streams.
the signal streams are value and time quantized, where C floats
are used to store the quantized values and time quantization can
be arbitrary, but is assumed to be synchronous for all nodes.
in the public GSL C API, engine modules are exposed as GslModule
structures, for the internal GSL engine implementation, each
GslModule is embedded in an OpNode structure.

node model:
-----------
* a node has n_istreams input streams
* a node has n_ostreams output streams
* all streams are equally value-quantized as IEEE754
  floats, usually within the range -1..1
* all streams are synchronously time-quantized
* the flow-system behavior can be iteratively approximated
  by calculating a nodes output streams from its input streams
* since all streams are equally time discrete, n output
  values for all output streams can be calculated from n input
  values at all input streams
* some nodes always react delayed ("deferred" nodes) and can
  guarantee that they can always produce n output values ahead
  of receiving the corresponding n input values, with n>=1
* a node that has no output facilities (n_ostreams==0) is
  considered a "consumer" and has to be processed

node methods:
-------------
->process()
  this method specifies through one of its arguments
  the number of iterations the node has to perform,
  and therefore the number of values that are supplied
  in its stream input buffers and that have to be supplied
  in its stream output buffers
->process_deferred()
  this method specifies the number of input values supplied
  and the number of output values that should be supplied.
  the number of input values may be smaller than the number
  of output values requested, in which case the node may return
  less output values than requested.

node relationships:
-------------------
node B is an "input" of node A if:
  * one of A's input streams is connected to one of B's output streams,
  or
  * node C is an "input" of A and B is an "input" of C

processing order:
-----------------
if node A has an input node B and A is not a deferred node, B has to
be processed prior to processing A.

connection cycles:
------------------
nodes A and B "form a cycle" if A is an input to B and B is an
input to A.

invalid connections:
--------------------
for nodes A and B (not necessarily distinct) which form a cycle,
the connections that the cycle consists of are only valid if
the following is true:
  (C is a deferred node) and
  (C==A or C==B or (if C is completely disconnected, the nodes
  A and B do not anymore form the cycle))


implementation notes
====================
* if a node is deferred, all output channels are delayed
* independent leaf nodes (nodes that have no inputs) can be
  scheduled separately
* nodes contained in a cycle have to be scheduled together

scheduling algorithm
--------------------
to schedule a consumer and its dependency nodes, schedule_query it:

schedule_query_node:
* tag current node
* ignore scheduled input nodes
* schedule_query_node on untagged input nodes, then do one of:
  * schedule input node (if it has no cycles)
  * resolve all input nodes cycles and then schedule
    the input nodes cycle (if not self in cycle)
  * take over cycle dependencies from input node
* a tagged node is added to the precondition list (opens new cycle)
* own leaf level is MAX() of input node leaf-levels + 1
* untag node

resolving cycles:
* eliminate child from precondition list, once the list
  is empty the cycle is resolved
* at least one node being eliminated has to be deferred
  for the cycle to be valid

scheduling:
* nodes need to be processed in the order of leaf-level
* within leaf-levels, processing is determined by a per-node
  processing costs hint (cheap, normal, expensive)

implementation considerations:
------------------------------
for deferred nodes, the number n specifying the amount of output
values that are produced ahead of input can be considered
mostly-fixed. that is, it's unlikely to change often and will do
so only at block boundaries.
supporting n to be completely variable or considering it mostly
fixed has certain implications. here're the considerations that
lead to supporting a completely variable n for the implementation:

n is block-boundary fixed:
+ for complex cycles (i.e. cycles that contain other cycles,
  "subcycles"), the subcycles can be scheduled separately
  if the n of the subcycle is >= block_size
- if n is the only thing that changed at a block-boundary,
  rescheduling the flow-graph is required in the cases
  where n = old_n + x with old_n < block_size or if x < 0
- deferred nodes can not change their delay in response to
  values of an input stream
  
n is variable for every iteration step:
+ no rescheduling is required if n changes at block-boundary
- subcycles can not be scheduled separately from their outermost
  cycle
+ the delay of deferred nodes can correlate to an input stream


threads, communication, main loops
==================================

thread types:
* UserThread; for the scope of the GSL engine (the functions exposed in
  gslengine.h), only one user thread may execute API functions
  at a time.
  i.e. if more than one user thread need to call engine API
  functions, the user has to take measures to avoid concurrency
  in calling these functions, e.g. by using a GslMutex which is
  to be locked around GSL engine API calls.
* MasterThread; the engine, if configured accordingly,
  sets up one master thread which
  - processes transactions from the UserThread
  - schedules processing order of engine modules
  - processes sole modules when required
  - processes module cycles when required
* SlaveThread; the engine can be configured to spawn slave threads which,
  in addition to the master thread
  - process sole modules when required
  - process module cycles when required

communication at thread boundaries:
* job transaction queue; the UserThread constructs job transactions and
  enqueues them for the MasterThread. the UserThread also dequeues already
  processed transactions, in order for destroy functions of modules and
  accessors to only be executed from the UserThread.
  also, the UserThread can wait (block) until all pending transactions
  have been processed by the MasterThread (in order to sync state with
  module network contained in the engine).
* module/cycle pool; the MasterThread fills in the module/cycle pool with
  modules than need to be processed. the MasterThread and the SlaveThreads
  pop modules/cycles from this pool, process them, and push back processed
  nodes.
* load control; FIXME

main loop integration:
in order to process certain engine modules only from within
the UserThread and to drive the engine even without master
or slave threads, the engine can be hooked up to a main loop
mechanism supplied by the UserThread.
the engine provides API entry points to:
- export file descriptors and timeout, suitable for main loop backends
  such as poll(2)
- check whether dispatching is necessary
- dispatch outstanding work to be performed by the engine
FIXME: needs mentioning of pollfd/callback jobs


TODO:
=====
- virtualization (poke ibuffer into outbuffer) flag (needs memcpy for deferred nodes)
- flag UserThread nodes
- sample timed jobs
- need global timestamp
- need async-queues that have time-stamped jobs
- process only so much samples until a time-stamped
  job needs to be processed
- self-input cycles need to be resolved in parent as well
- node-locale async timestamped jobs
- engine-init: { block(pipe-fd), check } 
- sample-timed activation can offset node's block-boundary
- need complete_blocks_only flag in node classes
- cost rating: cost*n_inputs+cost*n_outputs
- multi-input(joint) streams: job_disconnect(dmod,distr,smod,sistr); (jstreams)
