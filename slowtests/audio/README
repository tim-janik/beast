Overview
========
This directory provides automatic testing of the audio output BSE synthesis
networks produce. Since changing algorithms might result in subtle differences
in the resulting audio files, 1:1 comparision of audio files (such as storing
an md5 hash) is not a good choice for an automated testing framework.

Thus, the tests are based on comparing features of audio files that are not
as fragile as a bytewise comparision, but still provide a good similarity
measure, such as the spectrum or the average signal energy. To see in detail
which features are supported, call bsefextract --help.

To run the currently available tests, there is a Makefile rule, so you can
type:

   make test

Adding a new test
=================

To add a new audio test, lets call it foo, you need to perform the following
steps:

1) create a foo.bse file with beast, which will generate appropriate output;
   ensure that the bse file terminates after some time (using the song
   sequencer is a good way to ensure this)

   save foo.bse in this directory (add it to the CVS)

2) add a new target to Makefile.am (look at the other tests to see how its done)

3) add the target to the FEATURE_TESTS line in Makefile.am

4) run make foo-test once, the test will fail, but you will generate a foo.tmp
   file, which you can move to the reference file using

     mv foo.tmp foo.ref

   you need to add add the created foo.reference to CVS

6) run make test, the newly added test should be executed and succeed now

Note, that if you need multiple tests for the same .bse file (for instance
because you want to set a different threshold for different features), you can
do so by adding multiple targets foo1-test, foo2-test,... using difference
reference file names for the tests, like foo1.ref, foo2.ref,...


Good features to use:
=====================
Generally, you can use bsefextract --help to find out about which features
to use and what they do.

As a recommendation, there are three features that are generally useful, and
should cover almost any case:

 * --avg-energy:    since this evaluates the energy, it will ensure that the
		    test file will stay "as loud as it used to be"

		    this is generally a good thing to assume

 * --spectrum:      this is a matrix feature which represents how the spectrum
		    changes over time - it represents approximately what you
		    view in the fft scope and approximately what you hear (over
		    time) when you listen to the file

		    using makes sense when your sound changes over time, and
		    you want to ensure that this stays the same

 * --avg-spectrum:  is an average of the spectrum; if you have a sound which
                    doesn't change over time, you only need to compare this
		    to ensure it sounds the same
                    if you have a sound which does change over time, it is
		    ok to add it as well

		    so you can safely always use this feature

If you use these features, you will get a good representation of "sounds the
same", so it is the feature set that you can use for almost any test.

There are special features that can be useful for special cases, like for
instance the --base-freq feature which determines the frequency of a signal
(could be useful for testing an oscillator frequency), so its a good idea to at
least read through the bsefextract help once, so you know whats there.
