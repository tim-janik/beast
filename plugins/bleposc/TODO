- unison
- pass modulators into inner loop computation
- if saw dc changes within on cycle, the impulse height is not correct
- seek: improve code quality (dc)
- seek: slope approximation
- seek: initial conditions for dest_phase != 0

- sync specialization
- possible table-of-exp2

OLD:
dc subsampling
