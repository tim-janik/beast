Interface integration work:

- generate s/bse/bsw/ for old API in mkapi
- move beast to newly generated API
- reimplement BSW signals on top of glue layer
- beast test run
- fix SFI/BSE serialization
- move primitive types from BSE (GSL) to SFI (constants, notes, time stamps)
- move GslRing and glue layer to SFI
- complete validation for records and sequences
- complete serialization code, split between values with/without pspec
- get sfidl to generate code into a different namespace
- deal with GValue returns of NULL in generated code
- handle non-validated sequences and records in generation code (things
  can be demarshalled in non-validated form after incompatible changes)
- nuke GError usages, provide logging mechanism?
- cleanup helper/util code in sfitype.h
- move BswLockFuncs into SFI, feature this with sfi_init()
- wrap sfi_init() in C API wrapper code
