Tue Nov 21 22:04:15 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnetutils.cc: reworked browser launching logic to work around
	launcher scripts failing unnoticed by executing browser programs
	asyncronously and executing browser launch scripts syncronously
	to check the exit code.
	added "browser" debug key and messages.
	due to unreliable exit codes or foreground/background execution
	behaviour, support had to be removed for the launcher scripts
	xdg-open, htmlview, browser-config and sensible-browser,
	added support for exo-open, galeon, epiphany, amaya and dillo.

	* birnetmsg.hh, birnetmsg.cc: added Msg::CustomType class through

	values of failing comparisons.

Wed Nov  1 11:46:10 2006  Stefan Westerfeld  <stefan@space.twc.de>

	* birnetcdefs.h: Applied Patch from Tim to define BirnetInt64 and

	formats on AMD64 emit compiler warnings.
	
	* birnetthreadimpl.cc: Use BirnetUInt64 arguments for thread table
	function implementations of thread_awake_after and
	thread_emit_wakeups, to be consistent with the thread table function
	pointers defined in birnetcdefs.h.

	for allmost all virtual classes. renamed Deletable::DestructionHook to
	Deletable::DeletionHook for consistency.

	* tests/infotest.cc (test_virtual_typeid): test VirtualTypeid methods.

Thu Sep 28 01:01:55 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnetcore.h: introduce BIRNET_CONSTRUCTOR which wraps gcc's 
	"constructor" argument. as a work around for gcc-3.3, which tends
	to forget to emit code for static constructor functions if 
	-finline-functions is activated, also add attribute "used".

	* birnetthread.h:
	* birnetmsg.h: use BIRNET_CONSTRUCTOR to declare constructor functions.

	* tests/threads.cc: added a check for proper constructor function
	invokation before main().

Mon Sep 25 02:10:43 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnetsignalslot.hh: fixed reference handling for Data slots, so
        reference types are supported as Data argument (they need to implement

	constructed at static mutex construction time (which can be a
	problem).

	* birnetthread.h, birnetthread.c: provide chain4init and
	unchain variants for recursive mutexes and conditions. this required
	reordering of the BirnetRecMutex fields. provide static declaration
	macros for recursive mutexes and conditions in C.

	* birnetsignalslot.hh: hook trampolines into the destruction phase
	of a Deletable, if the instance of a method trampoline is a Deletable.

	objects that trigger Deletable destruction hooks.

	* tests/threads.cc: test statically declared recursive mutextes and

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* Makefile.am: removed bogus $LIBZ which should be part of $BIRNET_LIBS.

	* configure.inc: check for zlib.h and -lz and provide $LIBZ as part
	of $BIRNET_LIBS

Thu Jul  6 23:43:06 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnet-zintern.c: gen_zfile(): add "+ 1" to the dumed data array size

	about the array size.

Thu Jul  6 23:18:46 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnetutils.[hc]: added birnet_zintern_decompress(), based on

	executable checks if none was found to be working. added support for the
	"xdg-open" browser launching script.
	
	* birnetutils.[hc]: moved url opener code and cleanup handler code from
	GXK here. provide:
	birnet_url_show(): show an url, show an error if no browser is present.
	birnet_url_show_with_cookie(): same as birnet_url_show() albeit setting
	a cookie before hand and then redirecting automatically to the actual url.
	birnet_url_test_show(): show an url, return false if no browser is present.
	birnet_url_test_show_with_cookie(): same as birnet_url_show_with_cookie()
	with false return code instead of a warning.
	birnet_cleanup_add(): register a cleanup handler with the default main loop.

	* Makefile.am: provide versioning information and BIRNET_SIZEOF_SYS_TYPESH_UINT.

	* birnetcore.h: include <sys/types.h> for uint, ssize and other types.
	used gcc modes to define type width now. resolve clashes when defining
	uint by checking BIRNET_SIZEOF_SYS_TYPESH_UINT.

	* birnetthreadxx.cc: fixed missing ThreadDescendant() constructor which
	the gcc-4.2.0 snapshot 20060530 failed to catch.

	* tests/datalist.cc: make all data keys static, otherwise we get crashes
	due to mixed up destruction order. (data keys should always be static).

	in C++ on 64bit.

Fri Jun  9 19:50:24 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnetthreadxx.hh: allow multiple invocations of relock() without
	unlock() on an auto locker and have the auto locker clear up these
	locks in its destructor. i.e. added a lock counter to auto locker.

	* birnetthreadxx.cc (_birnet_init_threads_cxx): 
	avoid std::list::size() which is O(N).

Thu Jun  8 00:00:10 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnetthreadxx.hh, birnetthreadxx.cc: added initialization queues for
	mutexes and conditions to allow static mutexes and conditions. however,

Tue Jun  6 14:34:53 2006  Stefan Westerfeld  <stefan@space.twc.de>

	* tests/threads.cc: Fixed bug in auto locker benchmark. It is
	necessary to take into account that the different loops will run with

	accordingly.

Tue Jun  6 02:03:07 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnetthreadxx.hh: reimplemented the AutoLocker class with the help of
	an inlined template wrapper object. all types of lockable objects are
	now supported, and the new implementation is actually faster.

	* threads.cc: call assert_impl() on the new auto locker which assert
	crucial implementation assumptions. added auto locker benchamrks for
	the former birnet implementation, an early heap based prototype and
	the current implementation.
