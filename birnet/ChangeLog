Sat Apr 22 17:54:12 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* birnettests.h (TEST_CALIBRATION): comment and whitespace fixups. 
	consolidated code bloat. tweaked timing bounds to speed up calibration
	runs. use g_printerr() for printouts.

Sat Apr 22 13:25:54 2006  Stefan Westerfeld  <stefan@space.twc.de>

	* birnettests.h: Added TEST_CALIBRATION macro, which allows benchmark
	tests to figure out how often to perform a test for a given CPU.
	Besides the actual benchmark code, it allows the programmer to specify
	how much time the bencharking should take, and a suitable number of
	repetitions for the test code is computed.

	* birnetutilsxx.cc: Use g_path_get_basename() to call g_set_progname()
	with the application name only (without the full path).

Sat Apr 15 03:18:53 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	the CPU features. in particular, detect the available (SIMD)
	instruction sets at runtime. currently supports i368 and
	amd64 via CPUID.

	* birnetcore.h: provide wrapper macros for GCC attributes.

	* tests/infotest.cc: test the CPU info API.
